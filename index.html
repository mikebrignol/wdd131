            I am a dedicated Computer Science student with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. Throughout my studies, I have gained solid knowledge in programming, algorithms, software development, and data structures. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to real-world challenges, whether through academic projects, personal coding practice, or teamwork.

I am particularly interested in fields such as artificial intelligence, web development, and cybersecurity. I believe that technology has the power to improve lives, and I am committed to using my skills to contribute to meaningful solutions. As I continue my academic journey, I am focused on building both technical expertise and strong communication skills to prepare for a successful career in the tech industry.
